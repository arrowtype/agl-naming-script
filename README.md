# agl-naming-script

A script to run through UFOs and apply AGL naming for glyphs, in order to ensure they work well in PDFs, PostScript printing, etc.

See https://silnrsi.github.io/FDBP/en-US/Glyph_Naming.html for details on working vs production glyph names.

See https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-specification for the AGL spec.
