"""
    Goes through glyphs in a UFO font source and applies AGL (Adobe Glyph List) names, based on Unicode values.

    Run on the command line, pointing to a folder containing UFOs. See README for details.

        python3 script/set-prod-names.py -u sources

    Current assumptions:
    - Glyphs have only one Unicode value each (it is possible, but rare, for glyphs to have multiple Unicodes pointing to them)
    - Fonts do not have glyphs that are ligated (which would need names like 'uni20AC0308', mapped to the string U+20AC U+0308)
